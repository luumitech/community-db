# community-db

A database for community.  Keeping record of household within small community, events, memberships, etc..

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

To start development server in HTTPS mode and HTTP/2 mode, refer to `nginx/README.md`.  This project uses SSE (Server Sent Events) to perform graphQL subscription, using HTTP/1 would work as well, but with some restrictions.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Setting up mongodb

The mongo DB must be configured with replication set:

- stop mongo service: `brew services stop mongodb-community`

- update mongo config `$(brew --prefix)/etc/mongod.conf` file with replication props:

    ```sh
    systemLog:
      destination: file
      # Change /opt/homebrew/var to /usr/local/var (if on intel)
      path: /opt/homebrew/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log
      logAppend: true
    storage:
      # Change /opt/homebrew/var to /usr/local/var (if on intel)
      dbPath: /opt/homebrew/var/mongodb
    net:
      bindIp: 127.0.0.1
    replication:
      replSetName: "rs0"
    ```

- start mongo service: `brew services start mongodb-community`

- while mongod is running, run `mongosh`, then:

    ```sh
    rs.initiate({_id: 'rs0', members: [{_id: 0, host: '127.0.0.1:27017'}]});
    ```

- if you need to apply new configuration, then:

    ```sh
    rs.reconfig({_id: 'rs0', members: [{_id: 0, host: '127.0.0.1:27017'}]}, {force:true});
    ```

## Updating mongo schema

When indexes in the mongo schema are modified, you will need to run:

```sh
yarn update-prisma-db
```

## Updating landing page screenshots

The screenshots in the landing page are generated by cypress, with `cypress/e2e/landing-screenshot.cy.ts`.  Normally, this test is excluded from cypress test run, so it must be manually run to recreate the screenshots.

```sh
# On one terminal, start the dev server
yarn dev:cypress
# On another terminal, start the cypress UI
yarn cy:open
# Then select `landing-screenshot` spec file and run it.  The first few invocation
# may fail because dev server takes time to compile the different endpoint.  Run
# them repeatedly until the test case passes, and all the screenshots will be saved
# in the appropriate directory
```

## Prerequiste for deploying to Microsoft Azure

In [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com):

- create Resource Group `<group-name>`
- create Container Registry `<registry-name>`
- create App Service `<app-name>`

Install Azure CLI:

```shell
brew update
brew install azure-cli

# Sign in to Azure
az login
```

## Building docker image

### Build new docker image to Azure container registry

```shell
# clone git repository
# On windows box, it's important to keep the CRLF of the repository file
# because files like `docker/entrypoint.sh` need to have LF line ending (not CRLF)
git clone git@github.com:luumitech/community-db.git --config core.autocrlf=input

# To push a new image and tag it as `dev``
# Tagging an image with 'dev' will trigger a webhook to deploy the image into dev slot
./script/azure/build-image.sh --tag=dev
```

### Build new docker image to Docker container registry

```shell
# clone git repository
# On windows box, it's important to keep the CRLF of the repository file
# because files like `docker/entrypoint.sh` need to have LF line ending (not CRLF)
git clone git@github.com:luumitech/community-db.git --config core.autocrlf=input

# To push a new image and tag it as `main``
# Tagging an image with 'main' will trigger a webhook to deploy the image into main slot
./script/docker-hub/build-image.sh --tag=main
```
